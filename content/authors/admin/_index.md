Hey, I am a professional Business Risk Manager (aka Trust and Safety in other internet companies) in [Lazada Group](https://group.lazada.com). I am in charge of the Advertising Business Risks. On my current job, I work very closely with Advertising Business, Advertising Product, Risk Algorithm and Risk Product team etc. to set the Ads Risk Strategy and Policy. I leverage the Data Analytics skills to monitor and analyze the algorithm performances (Accuracy and Recall). I work with Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists to launch/improve various algorithms to detect and mitigate the Ads risks. Before I moved to Business Risk, I was a Product Manager for Enterprise Technology products in Lazada for 2 years. 

In the meantime, I am also a part-time Masters student in School of Computing and Information Systems in [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg). My program is [Master of IT in Business](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business) on FinTech and Data Analytics field. This program equips me with data engineering, data analytics, data science and business intelligence skills which tremendously are useful in my day-to-day work.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading technology articles, building Data Visualizations and learning new technologies. I am also a wanderlust and foodie!
