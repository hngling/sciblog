Hey, I am a professional Business Risk Manager (aka Trust and Safety in other internet companies) in [Lazada Group](https://group.lazada.com).  

I oversee the risks associated with advertising solutions (aka Monetization) products: Sponsored Search, Sponsored Product and Sponsored Affiliate. I conduct the risk assessment for ads products and also develop and update the risk policy, SOP and workflow.  My stakeholders include Advertising Business, Advertising Product, Risk Algorithm and Risk Product team etc.  

On my daily work, I deal with large data sets and leverage data analytical tools (like SQL, Python, R) to develop evidence-based and automated risk strategies. I build the BI Dashboards to monitor the risk metrics. Also, I work with algorithm engineers and data scientists to launch/improve various algorithms for Ads risks. Before I moved to Business Risk, I was a Product Manager for Enterprise Technology products in Lazada for 2 years. 

In the meantime, I am also a part-time Masters student in School of Computing and Information Systems in [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg). My program is [Master of IT in Business](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business) on FinTech and Data Analytics field. This program equips me with data engineering, data analytics, data science and business intelligence skills which tremendously are useful in my day-to-day work.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading technology articles, building Data Visualizations and learning new technologies. I am also a wanderlust and foodie!
