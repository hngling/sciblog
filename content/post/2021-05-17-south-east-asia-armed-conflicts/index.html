<p>Armed conflicts consists in the use of armed force between two or more organized armed groups, governmental or non-governmental, by definition from International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>In South East Asia context, the Armed Conflicts have been ongoing for a long time. In 1950s, internal conflicts took place in Myanmar. In 1960s, insurgency happened in South Thailand. You can find the full list on wikipedia. In this paper, we did visual analytics on the recent Armed Conflicts in South East Asia from 2015 to 2020 and explored some spatial-temporal patterns from it.</p>
<div id="objective" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Objective</h1>
<p>Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project <a href="https://acleddata.com">(ACLED)</a> collected all the raw dataset about the Armed Conflicts globally. Prof. Kam made a spatial-temporal data visualization <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/tskam#!/vizhome/South-eastAsiaArmedConflictAnalysis/South-eastAsiaArmedConflictAnalysis">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="originalchart.png" /></p>
<p>After checking the <a href="Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31.xlsx">raw dataset</a>, I think we can have a better way to visualize the data so the users would be able to interpret the Armed Conflicts situation in South East Asia easily.</p>
<p>In this paper, firstly I criticized the original data visualization with some suggestions, then it followed up with implementation in Tableau tool. At the end of the paper, a few important insights were derived from my data visualization.</p>

<div id="critics-and-recommended-improvements" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Critics and Recommended Improvements</h1>
<p>In 2012, Ben Jones published an article about the key principles of Data Visualization. In short, we should visualize the data clearly and aesthetically. To support that, he created a <a href="https://dataremixed.com/2012/05/data-visualization-clarity-or-aesthetics/">Cartesian coordinate system</a> as shown below.
<img src="principles.png" /></p>
<p>According to coordinate system, I observed some clarity and aesthetic issues.

<td>On the spatial map, 6 different event types are represented by 6 different colors in circle shape. All the circles are scattered across the map and they mix with each other. It looks a bit messy and makes the users difficult to identify each event type and compare one with another.</td>
<td>We should abandon the circle shape. I suggest to use the Pie chart to illustrate the Event Types at the country level. It will allow the users to interpret the data easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>The line chart tries to show 6 different event types. But the sequence of the event types does not match the sequence in the legend. It is confusing the users. Besides, Fatalities data is found in the raw dataset but it is not plotted in the line chart.</td>
<td>We need to re-plot the line chart for the Event Types and put all event types in one chart with different colors. Fatalities data is quite informational for the users to understand how severe the Armed Conflicts situation is, so we should plot the Fatalities data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>The X-axis title “Event Date” is not correct because the line chart shows the data aggregated at the Year level rather than Day level. Besides, the Year 2020 data only includes the data from 2020/01/01 to 2020/10/31, but this point is not highlighted. In the meantime, the different Event Types have different scales of Y-axis and it causes misconceptions. For instance, Battles’ scale is ‘400~700’ whereas Riots’ scale is ‘5~20’.</td>
<td>We should remove the X-axis title “Event Date”. Then, we need to highlight that the data for Year 2020 is cut off at Oct-31, 2020. We need to put all the types in one chart and then use different colors to differentiate them and also synchronize the scale for all types.</td>

<p>However, I would like to point out a few things to take note. Our objective is to evaluate the events data and fatalities data at the country level such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia etc. Therefore, many unnecessary columns in the raw dataset will be ignored.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>ADMIN1</strong>, <strong>ADMIN2</strong> and <strong>ADMIN3</strong> etc. columns are lower level administrative regions. We do not need them in this visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Sub-Event Types</strong> are sub-level of <strong>Event Types</strong>. Since there are too many sub Event Types, let us just focus on the Event types.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> are for the specific region/city rather than the country itself. We cannot use it as our intention is to plot at country level.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Event Date</strong> column will not be used since we already have the <strong>Year</strong> column. In this visualization, we are only concerned at Year level.</p></li>
