### 3.  FAA Investigating Controversial Crash Video  
The FAA has confirmed it's investigating the circumstances of a video purporting to show the November crash of a 1940 Taylorcraft posted by YouTuber Trevor Jacob. "The FAA is investigating this event," the agency said in a statement issued Monday. "The agency does not discuss open investigations."  The video prompted an explosive and generally harsh reaction from commenters on YouTube and on various forums. Many are calling for an investigation into the production of the video; a few are calling it fake. And plenty have analyzed it frame by frame to support their accusations about its authenticity.
