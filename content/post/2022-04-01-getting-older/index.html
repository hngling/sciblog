<p>Population aging is a well-known phenomenon for many years in Singapore. But how does it affect the labor force market?</p>
<p>Recently, I gathered the Residents labor force data (from 2009 to 2019) from Singapore Ministry of Manpower website. In this post, I wanted to share some of the insights derived from my data visualization. In my data visualization, I compared the residents Labor Force Participation Rate in 2009 with that in 2019. Besides, I compared the Shares of different Age Groups in the labor market in 2009 and in 2019. The tool I used is Tableau.</p>
<div id="objective" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Objective</h1>
<p>Singapore Ministry of Manpower released the report <a href="https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx">Labour Force in Singapore 2019</a> on 30-Jan-2020. On the page #22, it threw a statement that <strong>‘More older residents in labor force’</strong> and then illustrated it with the chart <strong>‘Residents Labor Force by Age’</strong>. I attach the snapshot as below.

<p>After check the <a href="https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx">original data</a> - Table 5, We feel that this illustration is misleading and cannot fully support the statement.</p>
<p>Therefore, I made some changes on the illustration to better support the statement.</p>

<div id="critics-and-recommended-improvements" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Critics and Recommended Improvements</h1>
<p>First of all, the original chart contains a few Clarify issues and Aesthetic issues.</p>
<div id="clarity-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Clarity Issues</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Y-axis does not exist, then it is very tough to gauge the heights. In addition, these two lines do not have the dots/markers which can highlight the value.<br />
</li>
<li>The shares of Age-groups for June 2009 and June 2019 are stacked together with the Age-groups as the X-axis. It looks like a data table, which undermines the usage of the chart. Since the two solid-lines are used to indicate the percentage of the share of Age-groups, it is redundant to show the numbers again at the bottom.<br />
</li>
<li>The ‘Per Cent’ should not displayed as the subtitle of the chart. Instead, it should be displayed as the unit of the Y-axis. The subtitle is on the top left corner whereas the shares of Age-group are at the bottom (i.e., X-axis). So, it makes the users difficult to interpret the chart.<br />
</li>
<li>The two reference lines (Median Age) neither mean the Age-group (e.g., 40-44, 45-49 etc.) nor mean the share of the Age-groups (e.g., 13.3%, 12.2% etc.). They are just purely two numbers (41 and 44). So, they should not refer to the X-axis. It could be displayed as an annotation.<br />
</li>
<li>The title and subtitle are not helpful for users to understand the context.<br />
</li>
<li>The LFPR data is mentioned in the statement, but it is not shown in the chart.<br />
</li>
<li>The statement compares the shares of labor force Aged 25~54 with the one Aged 55 or over. But it is not clearly illustrated in the chart.</li>
</ol>
