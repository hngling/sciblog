Every one of us, at some point of time in our life, was wondering what is happiness formula? Power? Wealth? Health? Others?

Being inspired by this question, we decide to explore it and hopefully we can dig out some insights.

# 1. Motivation

<span style="color:navy">**Happiness**</span> leads to a wide range of benefits for our performance, health, relationships and more. So, rather than success being the key to <span style="color:navy">**Happiness**</span> , research shows that <span style="color:navy">**Happiness**</span>  could in fact be the key to success. Indeed, <span style="color:navy">**Happiness**</span>  also brings substantial benefits for society. <br>

The <span style="color:blue">_World Happiness Report_</span> is an annual survey by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations, revealing some countries are quite consistently outperforming in Happiness. The report measures 156 countries, ranking countries using the Gallup World Poll and six factors: levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and corruption income.<br>

In general, with the Government focus of generating wealth and economic growth, there is an assumption that leads 'naturally' to <span style="color:navy">**Happiness**</span> and improved quality of life for all residents. But is this true?
Specifically, by studying the relative achievements and correlations between countries and also over time, we can generate more insights of how <span style="color:navy">**Happiness**</span>  comes about. This information is important for individuals looking to emigrate, and for governments looking for good measure for actual 'quality of life' improvements.

# 2. Objective

Our project aims to show through a series of visualizations based on data analysis, to the audience regarding the actual factors influencing Happiness and also some comparisons between countries. 

By reviewing data and analyzing the trends of the <span style="color:blue">_World Happiness Report_</span> to uncover the key impacts and factors influencing the development of happiness, correlations between these factors for different countries  <span style="color:green">**from 2015 to 2020**</span>( last report was done in March 2020).


# 3. Data Visualization Approaches

We aim to present this view with EDA charts and world Happiness Map.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Checking the R packages and Load them
```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
packages = c('dplyr', 'plotly', 'lubridate', 'tidyverse', 'maps')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

### Load the raw data
```{r}
happiness2005to2020 <- read_csv("Data/score2005to2020.csv")
# extract the data from Year 2015 to 2020
happiness <- subset(happiness2005to2020,happiness2005to2020$Year>=2015)
```

### 1. Static plot via ggplot package - Happiness Score trend by Region
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
names(happiness)<-str_replace_all(names(happiness), c(" " = "."))
ggplot(happiness, aes(Year, Happiness.score, group=Region, color = Region, width = 6)) +
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean", size=1)+
  geom_point(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean", size=2)+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score by Year by Region") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = "bold", lineheight=.8, 
  vjust=1,family="Bauhaus 93"))+
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm"))
```

### 2. Interactive plot via plotly package - Happiness Score trend by Region
```{r}
happiness %>%
  group_by(Region, Year) %>%
  summarise(score_mean=mean(Happiness.score)) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~Year, y=~score_mean,  type="scatter", mode="lines+marker", color=~Region) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Happiness Score by Year by Region",
    xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Average Happiness Score")
    )
```

### 3. Happiness Score vs. Logged GDP Per Capita 
```{r}
g<-happiness%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Logged.GDP.per.capita, y = Happiness.score, color = Region))+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score vs. Logged GDP Per Capita", ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = "bold", lineheight=.8, 
  vjust=1,family="Bauhaus 93"))+
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm"))+
  theme(
      axis.title.x = element_text(color="cadetblue", vjust=-2),
      axis.title.y = element_text(color="cadetblue" , vjust=2)   
          )+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(vars(Year))
ggplotly(g)
```

### 4. Happiness Score vs. Social Support
```{r}
g<-happiness%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Social.support, y = Happiness.score, color = Region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Social Support", y="Happiness Score")+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score vs. Social Support") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = "bold", lineheight=.8, 
  vjust=1,family="Bauhaus 93"))+
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm"))+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(vars(Year))
ggplotly(g)
```

### 5. Happiness Score vs. Healthy Life Expectancy
```{r}
g<-happiness%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Healthy.life.expectancy, y = Happiness.score, color = Region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Healthy Life Expectancy", y="Happiness Score")+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score vs. Healthy Life Expectancy") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = "bold", lineheight=.8, 
  vjust=1,family="Bauhaus 93"))+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(vars(Year))+
  theme_minimal()
ggplotly(g)
```

### 6. Happiness Score vs. Freedom to Make Life Choices

```{r}
g<-happiness%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Freedom.to.make.life.choices, y = Happiness.score, color = Region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Freedom to Make Life Choices", y="Happiness Score")+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score vs. Freedom to Make Life Choices") +
  facet_wrap(vars(Year))
ggplotly(g)
```



### 7. Happiness Score vs. Generosity
```{r}
g<-happiness%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Generosity, y = Happiness.score, color = Region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Generosity", y="Happiness Score")+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score vs. Generosity") +
  facet_wrap(vars(Year))
ggplotly(g)
```



### 8. Happiness Score vs. Perceptions of Corruption
```{r}
g<-happiness%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Perceptions.of.corruption, y = Happiness.score, color = Region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Perceptions of Corruption", y="Happiness Score")+
  ggtitle("Happiness Score vs. Perceptions of Corruption") +
  facet_wrap(vars(Year))
ggplotly(g)
```


### Visualization of World Happiness Map

> <span style="color:blue">**A choropleth world map to represent an overview of the happiness score in Year 2020 geographically.** </span>



```{r, layout = "l-body-outset", fig.width= 12, fig.height= 6 }
g<- happiness %>%
  filter(Year==2020) %>%
  select(Country, Happiness.score) %>%
  rename(region = Country, "Happiness Score" = Happiness.score) %>%
  # Replace "United States of America" by USA in the region column
  # Replace "Hong Kong S.A.R. of China" by Hong Kong in the region column
  # Replace "Taiwan Province of China" by Taiwan in the region column
  mutate(
    region = ifelse(region == "United States", "USA", region),
    region = ifelse(region == "Hong Kong S.A.R. of China", "HongKong", region),
    region = ifelse(region == "Taiwan Province of China", "Taiwan", region)
    ) 

world_map <- map_data("world")
happymap <- left_join(g, world_map, by = "region")

ggplot(happymap, aes(long, lat, group = group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = `Happiness Score` ), color = "white")+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C")

```

<span style="color:red">**Some of the Countries in Africa is not showing up because we lack the data or the country names need to be fine tuned to adapt to the _maps_ package in R.** </span>

# 4. Observations & Insights

#### 1. Happiness is highly correlated to the economic factor i.e. GDP per Capita.
From the visualization above, we can observe that Western Europe, North America and ANZ have the largest Happiness score than other countries.

#### 2. Happiness is highly correlated to the Social Support too.
It is obvious that the countries with higher Social Support are happier than the rest.

#### 3. Life Expectancy may be correlated to Happiness.
By and large, the happier the country, the longer the life expectancy. However, we can find out the some East Asia countries without very high Happiness Score also have higher life expectancy. Perhaps it results from lifestyle and diet choices. Further study may be required to prove it.

#### 4. Happiness has no relationship with Generosity.
There is no clear relationship to link Generosity with Happiness. Countries with any Generosity could have high, moderate and low Happiness Score.
