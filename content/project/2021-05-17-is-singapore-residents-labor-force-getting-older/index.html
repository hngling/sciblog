<p>Population aging is a well-known phenomenon for many years in Singapore. But how does it affect the labor force market?</p>
<p>Recently, I gathered the Residents labor force data (from 2009 to 2019) from Singapore Ministry of Manpower website. In this post, I wanted to share some of the insights derived from my data visualization. In my data visualization, I compared the residents Labor Force Participation Rate in 2009 with that in 2019. Besides, I compared the Shares of different Age Groups in the labor market in 2009 and in 2019. The tool I used is Tableau.</p>
<div id="objective" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Objective</h1>
<p>Singapore Ministry of Manpower released the report <a href="https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx">Labour Force in Singapore 2019</a> on 30-Jan-2020. On the page #22, it threw a statement that <strong>‘More older residents in labor force’</strong> and then illustrated it with the chart <strong>‘Residents Labor Force by Age’</strong>. I attach the snapshot as below.
<img src="report.png" /></p>
<p>After check the <a href="https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx">original data</a> - Table 5, We feel that this illustration is misleading and cannot fully support the statement.</p>
<p>Therefore, I made some changes on the illustration to better support the statement.</p>
</div>
<div id="critics-and-recommended-improvements" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Critics and Recommended Improvements</h1>
<p>First of all, the original chart contains a few Clarify issues and Aesthetic issues.</p>
<div id="clarity-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Clarity Issues</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Y-axis does not exist, then it is very tough to gauge the heights. In addition, these two lines do not have the dots/markers which can highlight the value.<br />
</li>
<li>The shares of Age-groups for June 2009 and June 2019 are stacked together with the Age-groups as the X-axis. It looks like a data table, which undermines the usage of the chart. Since the two solid-lines are used to indicate the percentage of the share of Age-groups, it is redundant to show the numbers again at the bottom.<br />
</li>
<li>The ‘Per Cent’ should not displayed as the subtitle of the chart. Instead, it should be displayed as the unit of the Y-axis. The subtitle is on the top left corner whereas the shares of Age-group are at the bottom (i.e., X-axis). So, it makes the users difficult to interpret the chart.<br />
</li>
<li>The two reference lines (Median Age) neither mean the Age-group (e.g., 40-44, 45-49 etc.) nor mean the share of the Age-groups (e.g., 13.3%, 12.2% etc.). They are just purely two numbers (41 and 44). So, they should not refer to the X-axis. It could be displayed as an annotation.<br />
</li>
<li>The title and subtitle are not helpful for users to understand the context.<br />
</li>
<li>The LFPR data is mentioned in the statement, but it is not shown in the chart.<br />
</li>
<li>The statement compares the shares of labor force Aged 25~54 with the one Aged 55 or over. But it is not clearly illustrated in the chart.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="aesthetic-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Aesthetic Issues</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Colors of June 2009 and June 2019 do not contrast strongly with each other. They use the Dark Blue and Dark Grey.<br />
</li>
<li>All the text in the chart (except the Source and Note) use the same fonts.<br />
</li>
<li>Grid line is missing on the chart.<br />
</li>
<li>These two solid-lines (not the reference lines) do not have the dots/markers.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>Based on the issues, we proposed some improvements to handle these issues.</strong> </span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="improvements-for-the-clarity-issues-and-their-merits" class="section level3">
<h3>Improvements for the Clarity Issues and their merits</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add Y-axis, axis title and unit; -&gt; so it can be easier to gauge the heights.</li>
<li>Remove the stacked data (June 2009 and June 2019) from the bottom X-axis; -&gt; so it can make the chart looks clear and neat.</li>
<li>Remove the ‘Per Cent’ subtitle. Instead, set it as the unit of Y-axis; -&gt; so the end-users can interpret the unit of data.</li>
<li>Remove the two Reference line. Instead, add them as annotation; -&gt; it is to remove misleading reference line.</li>
<li>Change the title and subtitle to meaningful ones which reflect the context and objectives. -&gt; so the end-users can interpret the whole chart easily.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="improvements-for-the-aethetic-issues-and-their-merits" class="section level3">
<h3>Improvements for the Aethetic Issues and their merits</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Change the colors of 2009-June and 2019-June to make them contrast strongly; -&gt; so the comparison would be more obvious.</li>
<li>Change the fonts, use different fonts for axis title, Legend, Title and Annotation etc.; -&gt; then the key messages can be highlighted.</li>
<li>Add the grid lines for Y-axis; -&gt; so the end-users can interpret the chart easily.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="sketch-the-design" class="section level1">
<h1>3. Sketch the design</h1>
<p>As the report mentioned the Residents Local Force Participation Rate, we can add it into the chart as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The upper part of the chart is the Participation Rate of Ages in 2009-June versus in 2019-June.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower part of the chart is the Shares of Ages in 2009-June versus in 2019-June.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="data-preparation" class="section level1">
<h1>4. Data Preparation</h1>
<p>Since we wanted to add the Participation Rate in the chart, we need to download the original data and put it together with the Shares of Ages in one <a href="./LFPRandSharesByAges.xlsx">data table</a>.<br />
<em>Note: LFPR stands for Labor Force Participation Rate.</em></p>

<h1>7. Major Observations from final Data Visualization</h1>
<p>During the implementation progress, we can find out three major observations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For the Ages 15~24</strong>, in terms of Participation Rate and Shares in Total Labor Force, there are <strong>no big differences between 2009-June and 2019-June</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>In 2009-June the majority</strong> of Labor Force came from <strong>ages 25~54</strong> whereas <strong>in 2019-June the majority</strong> came from <strong>ages 25~59</strong>. It implies that people tend to stay longer years in their career. Perhaps more and more employers like to keep the older workers in the workplace, but further investigations are required to prove it.</li>
<li>In general, almost all ages have <strong>higher participation rate in 2019-June than in 2009-June</strong>.</li>
</ul>
