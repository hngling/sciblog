<p>Population aging is a well-known phenomenon for many years in Singapore. But how does it affect the labor force market?</p>
<p>Recently, I gathered the Residents labor force data (from 2009 to 2019) from Singapore Ministry of Manpower website. In this post, I wanted to share some of the insights derived from my data visualization. In my data visualization, I compared the residents Labor Force Participation Rate in 2009 with that in 2019. Besides, I compared the Shares of different Age Groups in the labor market in 2009 and in 2019. The tool I used is Tableau.</p>
<div id="objective" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Objective</h1>
<p>Singapore Ministry of Manpower released the report <a href="https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx">Labour Force in Singapore 2019</a> on 30-Jan-2020. On the page #22, it threw a statement that <strong>‘More older residents in labor force’</strong> and then illustrated it with the chart <strong>‘Residents Labor Force by Age’</strong>.</p>
