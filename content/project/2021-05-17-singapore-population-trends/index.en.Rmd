In this post, I would like to present three commonly used charts: Bar Chart, Pareto Chart and Quadrant Chart. The dataset I used is the Superstore 2020 sales data. You can download it from [here](./Superstore2020.xls). I created the charts in the Tableau Desktop and then published them on my Tableau Public website.

# 1. Bar Chart

A blend of Bar charts are to show each region's sales figure across **the quarters** from the year **2016 to 2019**.

# 2. Pareto Chart

Pareto Chart is very useful and the purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important components among a (typically large) set of factors. If you do not know what is Pareto Chart, you can find its definition in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_chart). In my Pareto Chart, I rank the state's sales in descending order. Then, calculate the running total percentage of the sales as the right side Y-axis.

# 3. Quadrant Chart  

In this chart, I plot each state's Sales and Profit. X-axis is the **state's Sales in Percentile** and Y-axis is the **state's Profit in Percentile**. 

The size of the bubble reflects the Sales revenue. That being said, the larger it is, the more sales it has.  

The color of the bubble means the Profitability. In other words, the green color indicate it's profitable whereas the red color indicates non-profitable.
